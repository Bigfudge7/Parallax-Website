        Quarantine a time and period of isolation. This lockdown has snatched away our
        daily life schedules, for our safety ofcourse. But should we stop our lives as well?
        It doesn't have to be that way. How we spend this time is upon us, let's change our perspective
        of how we look at this period of time and use this time effectively.
        Let's use this oppurtunity to be a better version of ourselves.<br>
        We'll look at 5 such things that you can implement to do the same.

      <p>
      In my opinion, <em><u>The Key To A Productive Day Starts the Night Before</u></em> if you
      want to have a successful day plan out your whole day the night before which
      will allow you to spend the upcoming day very efficiently. Set a simple goal
      which will make you better than the earlier day, this can be cleaning your
      room or doing cardio for 25 mins instead of 20 mins or covering half of a chapter/topic.
      Completing a simple goal will make you feel good about yourself and give you a sense of self-accomplishment.
      But, most importantly you'll have a <strong>PURPOSE!</strong>

      <p>
        Touch your inner space, which is nothingness, as silent and empty as the
        sky; it is your inner sky. Once you settle down in your inner sky, you
        have come home, and a great maturity arises in your actions, in your behavior. Then whatever you do has grace in it
        Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind.
        During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled
        thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress.<br>
        It's time we be aware of our wandering mind and find <u>inner peace.</u>

        <em><u>Fitness starts in your head. You must choose to eat clean, exercise regularly, and treat your body with respect.</u></em>
        Our bodies are designed to be active, staying at home
        we can perform many physical activities.
        Exercising and eating healthy will help us look good, feel good and also boost our immunity.
        The stronger immune system we have the better prepared we are to fight the virus.
        Every workout counts even if itâ€™s only for 15 minutes. Just do it.
        Our goal is not to be perfect but to be better than what we were.<br>
        <em>Ofcourse now we can't give the excuse that we don't have time.</em>

        <em><u>It is time to start something new and trust the magic of new beginnings.</u></em>
        Doing what makes you happy is very important for our mind and body.
        If you have a hobby you already love then go ahead take it to the next level.
        Even if you don't have one already it's okay, you finally have enough time to explore new things
        be it playing an instrument, dancing, playing chess, drawing etc.
        <b>Make sure you look for your creative side</b> it's just the perfect time to
        do what makes you happy without having to worry about time being wasted.<br>
        Explore new things, get out of that <strong>comfort zone!</strong>

        Use this time to reach out to your friends and family members who you have
        distanced yourself from due to your regular daily schedules. Spend some
        quality time with your family and enjoy home cooked food and reduce some of the personal distancing
        during this social distancing. You can engage in tasks with your family like cooking and cleaning your house etc.<br>
        You can also use this time to build contacts online. Connect with people through social media and networking websites like
        linkedin, get noticed by recruiters, set up new meetings with potential clients and investors, there are endless possibilities
        in which communicating can help you
